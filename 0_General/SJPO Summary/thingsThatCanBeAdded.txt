Moment of Inertia for common objects
common results of Gauss' law for EM
Gauss' law can also use for gravitational field
Standing waves might be helpful to add general expressions of the 
wavelength for different harmonics
diffraction grating equation
fluid continuity equation (a_1v_1 = a_2v_2)
	where a = cross sectional area of flow
	where v = velocity of the fluid at that point
	essentially conservation of fluid
Malus law only works for plane polarized light
