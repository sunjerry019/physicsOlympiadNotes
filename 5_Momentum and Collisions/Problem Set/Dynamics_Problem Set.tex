		\question{
			You, at \SI{70.0}{\kilogram}, are standing stationary on a sheet of ice that covers the football stadium parking lot in Buffalo; there is negligible friction between your feet and the ice. A \SI{50.0}{\kilogram} friend throws you a \SI{0.400}{\kilogram} ball.

				\begin{solution}

			\textbf{[Poorly Maintained Car]} John was driving his \SI{1.50e3}{\kilogram} car up a hill when the engine suddenly dies and the gear disengages, causing his vehicle to free-wheel\footnote{The wheels are no longer driven by the engine}. Having missed his car servicing for many years, his brakes were also faulty. Hoping to stay alive, he jumps out of the car as his car slows to a momentary stop along the hill at $h = \SI{100}{\meter}$ above sea level. As he turns around, he sees his car roll down the hill and crash into a \SI{5.00e3}{\kilogram} truck parked at the bottom of the hill.

		\question{
			A \SI{15.0}{\kilogram} block is attached to a very light horizontal spring of force constant \SI{500}{\newton\per\meter} and is resting on a frictionless horizontal table. Suddenly it is struck by a \SI{3.00}{\kilogram} stone travelling horizontally at \SI{8.00}{\meter\per\second} to the right, whereupon the stone rebounds at \SI{2.00}{\meter\per\second} horizontally to the left. Find the maximum distance that the block will compress the spring after the collision. (\textit{Hint:} Break this problem into two parts --- the collision and the behaviour after the collision --- and apply the appropriate conservation law to each part.)

		\question{
			\textbf{[Walking in a boat]} A \SI{45.0}{\kilogram} woman stands up in a \SI{60.0}{\kilogram} canoe of length \SI{5.00}{\meter}. She walks from a point \SI{1.00}{meter} from one end to a point \SI{1.00}{meter} from the other end. If the resistance of the water is negligible, how far does the canoe move during the process?

				\pagebreak
			\fi
			\begin{solution}
				Suppose the woman moves at some point with some velocity $v_w$ to the right \underline{relative to the stationary river bank}. We define right as positive. By conservation of momentum, we know that:
				\begin{align*}
					m_wv_w + m_cv_c &= 0\\
					v_c &= -\frac{m_w}{m_c}v_w
				\end{align*}
				\vspace{-0.8cm}
				
				Integrating both sides, 
				\begin{align*}
					\int_{t = 0}^{t = t} \dod{S_c}{t} ~\dif t &= -\frac{m_w}{m_c} \int_{t = 0}^{t = t} \dod{S_w}{t} ~\dif t \\
					S_c - S_{c_0} &= -\frac{m_w}{m_c}\left(S_w - S_{w_0}\right) \\
					S_c &= -\frac{m_w}{m_c}S_w 
				\end{align*}
				Since the woman moves \SI{3}{\meter} relative to the canoe, we obtain $S_w = 3.00 + S_c$:
				\begin{align*}
					S_c &= -\frac{45.0}{60.0} \left(3.00 + S_c\right) \\
					S_c \left(1 + \frac{3}{4}\right) &= -\frac{3}{4}(3) \\
					S_c &= -\frac{\nicefrac{9}{4}}{\nicefrac{7}{4}} \\
					&= -\SI{1.29}{\metre}
				\end{align*}
				Alternatively, using the fact that the centre of mass of the system stays in the same place relative to the river bank:
				\begin{equation*}
					\text{CoM of system} = \frac{(45.0)(1.00) + (60.0)(2.50)}{45.0 + 60.0} = \frac{13}{7} \text{m from the end of the canoe}
				\end{equation*}
				After walking, taking reference from the same point as previously:
				\begin{align*}
					\text{CoM of system} = \frac{(45.0)(4.00 + \Delta x) + (60.0)(2.50 + \Delta x)}{45.0 + 60.0} &= \frac{13}{7} \\
					\Delta x &= \frac{\left[\nicefrac{13}{7}\right]\left(105\right) - 330}{45.0 + 60.0} \\
					&= -\nicefrac{9}{7} \\
					&= -\SI{1.29}{m} \\
				\end{align*}
				\vspace{-1.5cm}
				
				The canoe has moved to the left by \SI{1.29}{\meter}.

		\question{\label{qn:stranded} \textbf{[Stranded on a lake]} You're stuck in a boat in the middle of a lake. Luckily, you brought your physics textbook. You decide to use your textbook to propel you back to the shore. You shoot your $\SI{3}{\kilogram}$ textbook horizontally overboard with a speed of $\SI{10}{\meter\per\second}$ with the slingshot on board. If you and the boat have the combined mass $M$ of $\SI{100}{\kilogram}$,
			\begin{parts}
				\part How long would it take you to reach the shore $\SI{60}{\meter}$ away after shooting your book?  (Ignore friction between the water and the boat.) 
				\begin{solution}$\SI{200}{\second}$\end{solution}
				\part (*CALC) Unfortunately, it starts raining at $t = \SI{100}{\second}$ as you float towards the shore. The rain, that is falling straight down, collects in your boat at a rate of $\dif m/\dif t=\sigma$. How long would it take you to reach the shore in total, assuming your boat does not sink?
				
				{\color{black!60!} 
					\textit{Hint:} if $y = e^x$, then $\ln y = x$. If you have yet to learn calculus, there are some hints in the appendix.
				}
			
				\begin{solution}
					\footnotesize
					\begin{multicols}{2}
						Let $x$ be the $\Delta t$ after $t = 100$
						\begin{align*}
						M(x) &= 100 + \sigma x \\
						v(x) &= \frac{P}{M(x)} = \frac{3 \times 10}{100 + \sigma x}\\
						\therefore \dod{S}{x} &= \frac{30}{100 + \sigma x} \\ 
						\int_{S(x = 0)}^{S(x = x)} \dif S &= 30 \int_{0}^{x} \frac{1}{100 + \sigma x} \dif x \\
						S &= 30 \left[\frac{1}{\sigma}\ln(100+\sigma x)\right]^{x}_{0} \\
						&= \frac{30}{\sigma} \left[\ln(100 - \sigma x) - \ln(100)\right] 
						\end{align*}
						We know from part (a) that $S = 30$:
						\begin{align*}
							30 &= \frac{30}{\sigma} \left[\ln(100 - \sigma x) - \ln(100)\right] \\
							\sigma &= \ln(100 - \sigma x) - \ln(100) \\
							&= \ln\left(\frac{100 - \sigma x}{100}\right) \\ 
							100e^\sigma &= 100 - \sigma x \\
							\implies x = \Delta t &= \frac{100\left(e^{\sigma} - 1\right)}{\sigma} \\ 
							t &= 100 + \frac{100\left(e^{\sigma} - 1\right)}{\sigma}
						\end{align*}
					\end{multicols}
				And indeed, we can check the limits:
				\begin{align*}
					\lim_{\sigma\to 0} \Delta t &= \lim_{\sigma\to 0} \frac{100\left(e^{\sigma} - 1\right)}{\sigma} \\
					&= \lim_{\sigma\to 0} \frac{100e^{\sigma}}{1} ~~~~ \text{By L'Ho\^pital's Rule}\\
					&= 100 \\
					\implies \lim_{\sigma\to 0} t &= \SI{200}{\second}
				\end{align*}
				which is the answer from part (a)
				\end{solution}
