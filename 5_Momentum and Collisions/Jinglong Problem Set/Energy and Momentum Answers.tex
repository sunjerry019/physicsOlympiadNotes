			\begin{solution} C \\ After collision, we have 2 pendulums of the same length. Since the period of a pendulum, given by \[T = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}~,\] is independent of mass, we know that their quarter-period will coincide regardless of their masses. Thus, they will meet again at the same point (i.e. the equilibrium point). \par For now, just take that this expression for the period of a pendulum is true and correct. We will derive it when we eventually get to the chapter of Oscillation. \par The derivation itself is not complicated. If you are feeling up to it, do look up ``Simple Harmonic Motion" for hints on how to do it. \end{solution}
			% For the derivation of the period of a pendulum, refer to Appendix \ref{appdx:pendulum}. Note that the derivation involves concepts that we have yet to learn in class.

			\question{A soccer ball approaches a player at \(v=\SI{12}{\meter/\second}\). At what velocity \(v\) should the player's foot move in order to stop the ball upon contact? Assume that the mass of the foot is much greater than that of the ball and that the collision is elastic.

				\choice{\(u=\SI{6}{\meter/\second}\) in the direction opposite to the original velocity of the ball.}

				\choice{This feat cannot be done.}

			\ifprintanswers
				\vfill
			\fi
			\begin{solution} C \\
				We first write down the conservation of momentum and kinetic energy:
				\begin{align*}
					m_{\! f}u_{\! f} + m_bu_b &= m_{\! f}v_{\! f} + m_bv_b \\
					\frac{1}{2}m_{\! f}u_{\! f}^2 + \frac{1}{2}m_bu_b^2 &= \frac{1}{2}m_{\! f}v_{\! f}^2 + \frac{1}{2}m_bv_b^2
				\end{align*}
				Simplifying:
				\begin{align}
					m_{\! f}u_{\! f} + m_bu_b &= m_{\! f}v_{\! f}  &\implies m_bu_b &= m_{\! f}\left(v_{\! f}-u_{\! f}\right) \label{eqn:6:com}\\
					m_{\! f}u_{\! f}^2 + m_bu_b^2 &= m_{\! f}v_{\! f}^2 &\implies m_bu_b^2 &= m_{\! f}\left(v_{\! f}^2-u_{\! f}^2\right) \label{eqn:6:coe}
				\end{align}
				Dividing \eqref{eqn:6:coe} with \eqref{eqn:6:com}, we obtain the classic equation of the relative speeds of approach and separation:
				\begin{align}
					u_b = v_{\! f} + u_{\! f} \label{eqn:6:rsoa}
				\end{align}
				At this point, as the mass of the feet is much greater than the mass of the mass of the ball, we can safely take that any momentum/energy imparted onto the feet by the ball is negligible, and thus $v_{\! f} = u_{\! f}$, obtaining $u_{\! f} = \nicefrac{12}{2} = \SI{6}{\meter\per\second}$ in the same direction as the original velocity $u_b$ of the ball.
				
				We can of course substitute \eqref{eqn:6:rsoa} into \eqref{eqn:6:com}:
				\begin{align*}
					m_bu_b &= m_{\! f}\left[\left(u_b - u_{\! f}\right) -u_{\! f}\right] \\
					&= m_{\! f} \left[u_b - 2u_{\! f}\right] \\
					2m_{\! f}u_{\! f} &= u_b\left(m_{\! f}-m_b\right) \\
					u_{\! f} &= \frac{1}{2} u_b \left[\frac{m_{\! f} - m_b}{m_{\! f}}\right]
				\end{align*}
				Indeed, if $m_{\! f} \gg m_b~$, then $~\displaystyle \frac{m_{\! f} - m_b}{m_{\! f}} \to 1$ and $\displaystyle u_{\! f} \to \frac{1}{2}u_b = \SI{6}{\meter\per\second}$
				
				{\color{black!70!} Interestingly, if $m_{\! f} = 2m_b$, then $u_{\! f} = 3$ and $v_{\! f} = 9$. Your feet will fly backwards at \SI{9}{\meter/\second} or \SI{32.4}{\kilo\meter/\hour} ... ouch}

They stick and become one \(\SI{2.0}{\kilo\gram}\) lump of clay. What proportion of the kinetic energy in the originally moving lump was turned into heat and sound during the collision?
				\begin{choices}
				\choice{0\%}
				\choice{25\%}
				\choice{50\%}
				\choice{75\%}
				\choice{100\%}
				\end{choices}
			\begin{solution} C \\
				First, we use the conservation of momentum to find the final velocity $v_{\! f}$
				\begin{equation*}
					v_{\! f} = \frac{\cancel{m}v}{2\cancel{m}} = \frac{1}{2} v
				\end{equation*}
				Then we find the initial and final kinetic energy:
				\begin{align*}
					\text{KE}_i = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 && \text{KE}_{\! f} &= \frac{1}{2}(2m)\left[\frac{1}{2} v\right]^2 \\
					&&& = \frac{1}{2}m\left[\frac{1}{2}\right]v^2
				\end{align*}
				Thus, 
				\begin{equation*}
					\frac{\text{KE}_i - \text{KE}_{\! f}}{\text{KE}_i} = \frac{1}{2} \implies 50\%
				\end{equation*}
				It is naturally much faster by observation after finding the initial and final KE.

			\question{A \(\SI{8.0}{\gram}\) bullet is shot into a \(\SI{4.0}{\kilogram}\) block, at rest on a frictionless horizontal surface. The bullet remains lodged in the block. The block moves toward a spring and compresses it by \(\SI{9.4}{\centi\meter}\). The force constant of the spring is \(\SI{1000}{\newton/\meter}\). Determine the initial speed of the bullet.
			\begin{solutionorbox}[40mm] \(\SI{740}{\meter/\second}\) \\
				Right after the collision, the block and the bullet is moving at:
				\begin{equation*}
					v_c = \frac{m_{\text{bullet}}v_{\text{bullet}}}{m_{\text{bullet}} + m_{\text{block}}}
				\end{equation*}
				and the combined block and bullet has kinetic energy:
				\begin{align*}
					\text{KE} &= \frac{1}{2}\left[m_{\text{bullet}} + m_{\text{block}}\right]v_c^2 \\
					&= \frac{1}{2}\left[m_{\text{bullet}} + m_{\text{block}}\right]\left[\frac{m_{\text{bullet}}v_{\text{bullet}}}{m_{\text{bullet}} + m_{\text{block}}}\right]^2 \\
					&= \frac{1}{2}\left[\frac{m_{\text{bullet}}^2v_{\text{bullet}}^2}{m_{\text{bullet}} + m_{\text{block}}}\right]
				\end{align*}
				All the KE is converted into EPE:
				\begin{align*}
					\text{EPE} = \cancel{\frac{1}{2}}kx^2 &= \cancel{\frac{1}{2}}\left[\frac{m_{\text{bullet}}^2v_{\text{bullet}}^2}{m_{\text{bullet}} + m_{\text{block}}}\right] = \text{KE} \\
					\frac{kx^2\left[m_{\text{bullet}} + m_{\text{block}}\right]}{m_{\text{bullet}}^2} &= v_{\text{bullet}}^2 \\
					v_{\text{bullet}} &= \sqrt{\frac{kx^2\left[m_{\text{bullet}} + m_{\text{block}}\right]}{m_{\text{bullet}}^2}} \\

			\begin{solutionorbox}[40mm] \[\frac{1}{2}\left(M+\frac{M^2}{m}\right)v^2\] 
				We first find the velocity of the man:
				\begin{equation*}
					v_m = \frac{Mv}{m}
				\end{equation*}
				Work done by the man becomes the kinetic energy of the boat and the man:
				\begin{align*}
					W &= \text{KE}_{b} + \text{KE}_{m} \\
					&= \frac{1}{2}Mv^2 + \frac{1}{2}m\left(\frac{Mv}{m}\right)^2 \\

			Since $X$ and $Y$ are at right angles to each other, we can resolve all momentum using the directions of $X$ and $Y$ as our coordinate system. Applying the conservation of momentum:

		\question[8]{
		As shown in the figure below, a ball slides along a frictionless ramp of length \(L\). As it reaches the bottom, it hits the board and slides up along the slope again. If the speed of the ball after the collision is 4/5 times of the speed of the ball just before the collision, find the total distance travelled by the ball when it comes to a complete stop.
		\begin{figure}[h]
		\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[scale=0.55, clip=false, trim=0 30 0 0]{2012_1}
		\end{center}
		\end{figure}
		\begin{solutionorbox}[170mm] $\displaystyle \frac{41}{9}L$ \\[0.5\baselineskip]
		\textit{This question requires the knowledge of finding the sum to infinity of a geometric progression. }
		
		First, let $h_i$ be the height and $d_i$ be the distance that the ball rolls to after the $i$-th rebound. To make our working more readable, we let $H_{i} = h_{i-1}$ and $D_{i} = d_{i-1}$. 
		
		By conservation of energy:
		\begin{align*}
			\text{GPE} = mgH_{i} &= \frac{1}{2}mv_{\text{btm}}^2 = \text{KE}\\
			v_{\text{btm}} &= \sqrt{2gH_{i}} \\
			v_{\text{rebound}} = \frac{4}{5}v_{\text{btm}} &= \frac{4}{5}\left(\sqrt{2gH_{i}}\right)\\ 
			\text{KE} = \frac{1}{2}mv_{\text{rebound}}^2 = \frac{1}{2}m  \left[\frac{4}{5}\left(\sqrt{2gH_{i}}\right)\right]^2 &= mgh_i = \text{GPE} \\
			\frac{1}{\cancel{2}} \cancel{m} \left[\frac{16}{25}\right]\left(\cancel{2}\cancel{g}H_{i}\right) &= \cancel{m}\cancel{g}h_i \\
			\implies h_i &= \frac{16}{25}H_{i} \\
			\because d_i = \frac{h_i}{\sin\theta} \implies d_i &= \frac{16}{25}D_{i}
		\end{align*}
		Thus, we deduce that the total distance travelled by the ball for each rebound $S_i$ and its sum $\sum_{i = 0}^{N} S_i$:	
		\begin{align*}
			S_0 &= L + \left[\frac{16}{25}\right]L &\sum_{i = 0}^{N} S_i &= \sum_{i = 0}^{N} \left[\left[\frac{16}{25}\right]^{n}\!\!L + \left[\frac{16}{25}\right]^{n+1}\!\!L\right]\\
			S_1 &= \left[\frac{16}{25}\right]L + \left[\frac{16}{25}\right]^2\!\!L &&= L + \left[\sum_{i = 0}^{N}2\left[\frac{16}{25}\right]^{n}\!\!L\right] + \left[\frac{16}{25}\right]^{N+1}\!\!L\\
			\dots \implies S_i &= \left[\frac{16}{25}\right]^{n}\!\!L + \left[\frac{16}{25}\right]^{n+1}\!\!L&&= L + 2\left[\left[\frac{16}{25}\right]\!\frac{1-\left[\frac{16}{25}\right]^N}{1-\frac{16}{25}}\right]L + \left[\frac{16}{25}\right]^{N+1}\!\!L\\
		\end{align*}
		As $N \to \infty$, the ball comes to a complete stop when it has travelled:
		\begin{align*}
			\sum_{i = 0}^{\infty} S_i &= L +2\left[\left[\frac{16}{25}\right]\!\frac{1-\cancelto{0}{\left[\frac{16}{25}\right]^N}}{1-\frac{16}{25}}\right]L + \cancelto{0}{\left[\frac{16}{25}\right]^{N+1}}\!\!L \\
			&=  L +2\left[\left[\frac{16}{25}\right]\!\frac{1}{1-\frac{16}{25}}\right]L \\
			&= L + \frac{32}{9}L \\
			&= \frac{41}{9}L
		\end{align*}

		\question[8]{
		Two wooden blocks \(A\) and \(B\), connected by an unstretched spring with a spring constant \(k = \SI{950}{\newton/\meter}\), are initially at rest on a frictionless surface. A bullet of mass \(\SI{50}{\gram}\) moving horizontally with a initial speed of \(v_0 = \SI{120}{\meter/\second}\) hits Block \(A\) and becomes embedded in it. The embedding takes place within a very short time. The mass of Block \(A\) is \(\SI{1.2}{\kilogram}\) and that of Block \(B\) is \(\SI{2.0}{\kilogram}\).
		\begin{figure}[h]
		\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[scale=0.6, clip=false, trim=0 25 0 10]{2011_3}
		\end{center}
		\end{figure}
		Calculate
			\begin{enumerate}
			\item{the maximum compression (\(\Delta x_{\mathrm{x}}\)) of the spring.}
			\item{the maximum and minimum speeds of Block \(B\) in its subsequent motion.}
			\end{enumerate}
		\begin{solutionorbox}[170mm]
			\(\SI{0.136}{\meter}\); \(\SI{0}{\meter/\second}\), \(\SI{3.7}{\meter/\second}\) \par
			To simplify our calculations, let $m_a$ and $v_a$ be the total mass and velocity of the bullet and Block A combined respectively. 
			\begin{align*}
				v_{a_0} &= \frac{p_i}{m_a} = \frac{(120)(5\times 10^{-3})}{1.25} = \frac{6}{1.25} = \SI{4.8}{\meter\per\second}
			\end{align*}
			Now, let's analyse the motion of the two blocks qualitatively. First, block $A$ would be would decelerate from \SI{4.8}{\meter\per\second} due to the spring. At the same time, block $B$ would start to accelerate due to the spring exerting a force on it. In the first cycle, the motion of the blocks would probably looks something like that:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item $\left(v_a > v_b\right) \rightarrow \left(v_a - v_b > 0\right) \rightarrow$ The blocks are moving closer towards each other.
				\item $\left(v_a = v_b\right) \rightarrow \left(v_a - v_b = 0\right) \rightarrow$ The blocks are at their closest.
				\item $\left(v_a < v_b\right) \rightarrow \left(v_a - v_b < 0\right) \rightarrow$ The blocks are moving away from each other.  
			\end{itemize}
			Since EPE is proportional to $x^2$, when the blocks are at their closest, the spring would also be maximally compressed. 
			
			By conservation of energy, 
			\begin{align}
				E_{total} = \frac{1}{2}kx^2 + \frac{1}{2}m_av_a^2 + \frac{1}{2}m_bv_b^2 &= \text{constant} = \frac{1}{2} m_av_{a_0}^2 \notag \\
				\implies kx^2 + m_av_a^2 + m_bv_b^2 &= m_av_{a_0}^2 \label{eqn:S2:coe}
			\end{align}
			Thus, when EPE is at maximum, we obtain:
			\begin{equation}
				kx_{\text{max}}^2 = m_av_{a_0}^2 - \left(m_a + m_b\right)v_{\text{xmax}}^2 \label{eqn:S2:xmax}
			\end{equation}
			By conservation of momentum, when $v_a = v_b = v_{\text{xmax}}$:
			\begin{align*}
				p_i &= \left(m_a + m_b\right)v_{\text{xmax}} \\
				v_{\text{xmax}} &= \frac{p_i}{m_a + m_b}
			\end{align*}
			Thus, substituting into \eqref{eqn:S2:xmax}:
			\begin{align*}
				x_\text{max} &= \sqrt{\frac{m_av_{a_0}^2 - \left(m_a + m_b\right)\left[\frac{p_i}{m_a + m_b}\right]^2}{k}} \\
				&= \sqrt{\frac{m_av_{a_0}^2 - \left[\frac{p_i^2}{m_a + m_b}\right]}{k}}\\
				&= \sqrt{\frac{1.25 \cdot (4.80)^2 - \left[\frac{6^2}{1.25 + 2.0}\right]}{950}}
				&= \doubleunderline{\SI{0.13659}{\meter}}
			\end{align*}
			By further analysis, we realize that the subsequent motion of these 2 blocks would be of an oscillatory nature. 
			
			The minimum speed of $B$ is when it has zero kinetic energy, i.e. $v_{b_\text{min}} = \doubleunderline{\SI{0}{\meter\per\second}}$
			
			The maximum speed of $B$ is not as simple to obtain (i.e. not by letting KE of $A$ be zero). This is because greater speed can be obtained if $A$ is moving in the opposite direction. The only limiting factor here is the total energy of the system.
			
			With reference to \eqref{eqn:S2:coe}, we realize KE of blocks $A$ and $B$ are at maximum when EPE is at minimum (i.e. zero):
			\vspace{-0.3cm}
			\begin{align}
				2E_{\text{total}} = m_av_{a_0}^2 &= m_av_a^2 + m_bv_b^2 \notag \\
				m_a(v_{a_0}^2 - v_a^2) &= m_bv_b^2
			\end{align}
			Combining with the conservation of momentum
			\begin{align}
				p_i = m_av_{a_0} &= m_av_a + m_bv_b \notag\\
				m_a(v_{a_0} - v_a) &= m_bv_b~, \label{eqn:S2:com2}
			\end{align}
			we obtain the relative speed of approach/separation equation:
			\begin{equation}
				v_{a_0} + v_a = v_b \implies v_a = v_b - v_{a_0} \label{eqn:S2:rel} 
			\end{equation}
			Indeed, this looks exactly like a perfectly elastic collision. Substituting \eqref{eqn:S2:rel} into  \eqref{eqn:S2:com2}:
			\begin{align*}
				m_a\left[v_{a_0} - \left(v_b - v_{a_0}\right)\right] &= m_bv_b \\
				2m_av_{a_0} &= v_b\left(m_b+m_a\right) \\
				v_b &= \frac{2m_av_{a_0}}{m_b+m_a} \\
				&= \doubleunderline{\SI{3.69}{\meter\per\second}}
			\end{align*}

			Of course, we can attempt to describe the oscillatory motion of the blocks in some function $f(t)$, but that is beyond the scope of this worked solution. If you are interested, please do go and try, it will be fun. :)
